1. The same IAM role is used on both EC2 instances to access S3 bucket
   resources, which increases the range of damage for the attack vector
2. The IAM role has a full access policy attached for S3 bucket resources,
   which violates the Least Privilege Principle
3. Security Groups has a 0.0.0.0/0 inbound rule for SSH access, which makes
   instances vulnerable.
4. HTTP is configured for the Load Balancer and EC2 instance rules but
   should be HTTPS for encrypted traffic as they are public facing
   resources.
